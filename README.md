# Custom ArchBang Install Script
* First thing you will need is the latest ArchBang installer
* Boot to the installer and connect to the internet
* Navigate to https://github.com/ze-angry-wombat/archbang_custom and download the zip
* Unzip the package, cd into the resulting directory, and run chmod a+x altinstall
* If you wish to edit any packages that get install you may do so, they are at the top of altinstall (nano altinstall)
* cp altinstall /usr/bin/.
* (I clean up my Downloads directory at this point as the script will re-download the zip folder)
* Then just type sudo altinstall and it will start installing apps
* After the apps comes the actual menu for installing the system
* Go through the steps and install the system.
* Reboot and welcome to the custom ArchBang
